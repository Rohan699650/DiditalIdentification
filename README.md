# 🎓 Blockchain-Based Student Digital Identification System

A secure and transparent platform that leverages **Blockchain** and **MongoDB** to verify student credentials. This system ensures the integrity, immutability, and easy accessibility of academic documents through decentralized technology.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Traditional document verification processes are time-consuming, prone to tampering, and heavily dependent on manual validation. Our system revolutionizes this by integrating **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)**, **Smart Contracts**, and **document hash verification** to create a trustworthy academic ecosystem.
 This system incorporates a Solidity-based smart contract to manage document verification, where document hashes are stored on the blockchain to ensure integrity and authenticity. A separate Solidity utility contract enables secure password matching for login or identity verification. Non-blockchain data, such as user details and document metadata, is stored in MongoDB. The frontend, developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, provides interfaces for both admin and student roles. Admins can log in to manage student verification requests, while students can register, upload certificates for verification, and access verified documents. The system addresses data security and privacy with decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials, leveraging blockchain for document verification without relying on full-scale blockchain transactions for all identity operations.
